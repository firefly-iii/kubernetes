<!--
Thank you for submitting new code to Firefly III, or any of the related projects. Please read the following rules carefully.

- Please do not submit solutions for problems that are not already reported in an issue.
- Unfortunately, Firefly III can't be your learning experience. If you're new to all of this, please open an issue first.
- Please do not open PRs to "discuss" possible solutions or to "get feedback" on your code. I simply don't have time for that.
- Pull requests for the MAIN branch will be closed.
- DO NOT include translated strings in your PR.
- PRs (or parts thereof) that only fix issues inside code comments will not be accepted.

If it feels necessary to open an issue first, please do so, before you open a PR.
